2. [FSM for Vector Transfer and Rotation in Verilog](https://github.com/aryapandit200408/FSMs_in_Verilog/blob/main/FSM2.md)

3. [Bus Based System Design in Verilog](https://github.com/aryapandit200408/FSMs_in_Verilog/blob/main/bus_based_system.md)

4. [Serial_Adder_System_Design in Verilog](https://github.com/aryapandit200408/Simple_System_Design_in_Verilog/blob/main/serial_adder_system.md)
