### This is a repo on my projects on System Design (including bus based systems, FSMs and much more) in Verilog

#### Contents:-
1. [Simple FSM Design from RTL Notation in Verilog ](https://github.com/aryapandit200408/FSMs_in_Verilog/blob/main/FSM1.md)

2. [FSM for Vector Transfer and Rotation in Verilog](https://github.com/aryapandit200408/FSMs_in_Verilog/blob/main/FSM2.md)

3. [Bus Based System Design in Verilog](https://github.com/aryapandit200408/FSMs_in_Verilog/blob/main/bus_based_system.md)
